#Things still left to build

##hbs-promise-server.js
- post route initiates a promise
    - create a timer promise
    - resolve after video is created (child_process.exec ends)

##Trump love server
- words validity checker
    
    
##Spinner Loader
- screen overlay with spinning circle
- (actual, animation of stuff happening)

##Validify-Engine:
- ingest text
- regex out special characters
- replace
    
    
    
##JWT-based app authentication

##Filename length: 255 characters
- overcome with random UUID or shortID filenames. Each file will be unique, so must impose file size limits (maybe 10mb each);
